   ==========================================================================
   TugasinWP V2 Design System
   ==========================================================================
   
   CSS Architecture (Phase 27: Performance Optimized):
   - critical.css     → Inlined in <head> (above-the-fold styles)
   - main-bundle.css  → Loaded as single file (all other styles)
   
   Source Files (for development - edit these, then rebuild bundles):
   - assets/css/base/       → Variables, reset, typography
   - assets/css/utilities/  → Accessibility, animations
   - assets/css/layout/     → Grids, header, footer, hero
   - assets/css/components/ → Buttons, cards, forms, FAQ, TOC
   - assets/css/pages/      → Single post, archive, CPT-specific
   - assets/css/_responsive.css → All media queries

   To rebuild bundles after editing source files, run:
   See htaccess-performance.txt for the PowerShell command.
